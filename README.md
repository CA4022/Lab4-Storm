# STORM

This lab asks you to try and set up a simple Storm topology.

<!--Note, maven must be installed and configured-->

# Storm: install and run your first topology

1. Download binary from the internet (using a mirror site)

`$ wget https://mirrors.whoishostingthis.com/apache/storm/apache-storm-2.2.0/apache-storm-2.2.0-src.tar.gz`

2. Unzip STORM binary (in current directory, use `$ -C ~/<dirname> ` to unzip in a different directory `<dirname>` under user home folder)

`$ tar -xvzf apache-storm-2.2.0-src.tar.gz `

3. If you do not have Maven installed and configure:
  - on Unix/Linux: `$ sudo apt-get install maven`
  - on Mac: `$ brew install maven`
  - check it installed correctly: `$ mvn -version`
  
4. Go into the storm-starter project within the examples folder: `$ cd examples/storm-starter`

5. Compile the jar files: `$ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`
   - Note: it should take a few minutes, and youâ€™ll see a lot of output with "Build Success" in the end

6. Run the workdcount topology example (previously compiled)
  - Locally: `$ mvn compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology=storm.starter.WordCountTopology` 
  - On a cluster: `$ bin/storm jar examples/storm-starter/target/storm-*.jar  storm.starter.ExclamationTopology`

## Note that to run a topology on a cluster you first need to run the cluster

# Questions
1. Where does the data come from?
2. How would you modify this code to make it case-insensitive?
